I am a cautious person.
I should first look around more carefully before I make any rash decisions.
Who am I?
Where am I?
How did I get here?
There are so many questions in my head, but I cannot think of any answers.
I must think...
After some time, my eyes get used to the darkness.
I see a little hole in the wall and there seems to be a red light coming out.
I think I can fit my hand in there...
Should I do it?
